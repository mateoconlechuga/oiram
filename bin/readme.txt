Oiram code was created from scratch based off of Super Mario 3 Advanced 4 mechanics. Images are copyright of Nintendo.
You should really check out the original game, and buy a Nintendo Gameboy Advance SP.
They are the best things ever, and an absolutely incredible platform.
Oiram is not affiliated with Nintendo, and is simply a humble attempt to recreate a truly amazing game.
